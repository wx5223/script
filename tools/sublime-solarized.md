# Solarized

Solarized is a color scheme created by [Ethan Schoonover](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized). There are [versions](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) for pretty much every editor out there, this is the one to get for Sublime Text 3.

## Solarized for Sublime Text

This color scheme is created for Sublime Text (2 and 3). It improves on the Solarized color schemes packaged with Sublime Text, by using the correct colors and optimizing for the syntax grammars available for Sublime Text 3.

To install it, use Sublime Package Control following [these instructions](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/installation).
